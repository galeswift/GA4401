Prototype a game in under 7 days
http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2438/how_to_prototype_a_game_in_under_7_.php

Setup: Rapid is a State of Mind

Embrace the Possibility of Failure - it Encourages Creative Risk Taking
Enforce Short Development Cycles (More Time != More Quality)
Constrain Creativity to Make You Want it Even More
Gather a Kickass Team and an Objective Advisor – Mindset is as Important as Talent
Develop in Parallel for Maximum Splatter
Design: Creativity and the Myth of Brainstorming

Formal Brainstorming Has a 0% Success Rate
Gather Concept Art and Music to Create an Emotional Target
Simulate in Your Head – Pre-Prototype the Prototype
Development: Nobody Knows How You Made it, and Nobody Cares

Build the Toy First
If You Can Get Away With it, Fake it
Cut Your Losses and "Learn When to Shoot Your Baby in the Crib"
Heavy Theming Will Not Salvage Bad Design (or "You Can't Polish a Turd")
But Overall Aesthetic Matters! Apply a Healthy Spread of Art, Sound, and Music
Nobody Cares About Your Great Engineering
General Gameplay: Sensual Lessons in Juicy Fun

Complexity is Not Necessary for Fun
Create a Sense of Ownership to Keep 'em Crawling Back for More
"Experimental" Does Not Mean "Complex"
Build Toward a Well Defined Goal
Make it Juicy!

Juicy Breakout
==============

An example that we made for a talk at Nordic Game Indie Night: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg

You can try the game here: http://grapefrukt.com/f/games/juicy-breakout/

A juicy game feels alive and responds to everything you do
tons of cascading action and response for minimal user input.
